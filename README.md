# ForgeCraft

Directly inspired by the source code for a similar voxel engine described in these blog posts: ~~https://vazgriz.com/189/creating-minecraft-in-one-week-with-c-and-vulkan/~~ 
For some reason these posts are now offline so my version appears to be all that remains.

## Build Instructions

This project uses premake as it's build system to ease development!

Note: This is an abandoned project largely based off of someone else's work I did while bored in CS A. If you're curious about how some of this works I am too. Feel free to fork and mess around with it though!
